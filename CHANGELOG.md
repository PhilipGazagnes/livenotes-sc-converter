# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **PatternParser**: empty pattern definitions (`$1` with no content) are now valid and stored as `""`.

- **SectionParser**: label-only sections (a section name with no pattern and no `--`) are now valid structural placeholders. Previously the parser threw `E1.4.1`. The section is stored with `pattern: ""` and `lyrics: []`, and behaves identically to a section with an empty pattern definition. Previously the parser threw `E1.2.2`. This matches the spec, which explicitly allows empty patterns as song-skeleton placeholders. Downstream phases already handled `""` correctly (`json: null`, `measures: 0`).

- **SectionParser**: sections without a `--` separator (instrumental, no lyrics) now correctly end at the first empty line. Previously, the parser kept consuming the following section's content into the current section's pattern, causing `PatternTransformer` to fail with an invalid chord error on the next section's name or pattern reference.

### Tests

- Added tests 1.4.21–1.4.23 covering: multiple consecutive sections without `--`, multi-line loop patterns without `--`, and mixed sections (some with, some without `--`).

- Multi-chord measure support
- Special symbols (`%`, `_`, `=`)
- Measure counting with loop expansion

**Phase 3: Validation**
- Time signature validation
- Measure count validation
- Lyric timing validation
- Section modifier validation

**Phase 3.5: Lyric Transformation**
- Lyric string to object transformation
- Style detection (normal, info, musician)
- Measure count association

**Phase 4: Prompter Generation**
- Pattern expansion and loop resolution
- Measure stacking with modifiers
- `_before` and `_after` support
- `_cutStart` and `_cutEnd` support
- `_repeat` modifier support
- `%` repeat symbol resolution

- Pattern definitions with loops: `[A;G;C;D]3`
- Multi-chord measures: `A B G D`
- Line breaks in patterns: `:`
- Special symbols: `%` (repeat), `_` (empty), `=` (remover)
- Section modifiers: `_repeat`, `_cutStart`, `_cutEnd`, `_before`, `_after`
- Section overrides: `@bpm`, `@time`
- Lyric timing: `_N` (measure counts)
- Lyric styles: `***info***`, `:::musician:::`
- Comments: `!comment text`
